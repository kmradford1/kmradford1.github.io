## Volstead Act Business Card

Jacob Schreiber from the Volstead Act. The Volstead Act is a popular bar in downtown Spokane that features many delicious craft cocktails. The bar is wooden as are a lot of the surfaces in the bar so I wanted to use that in the design of the card.

This business card has a unique barrel shape to it. In order to have it printed and cut a die had to be made. I made it with this shape to emulate the barrels that Jake uses to age some of his spirits.
